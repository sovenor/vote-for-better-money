        <p>
        Every 4 years, we vote for someone who promises to fix America.
        <br /><br />    
        But after they're elected, they rarely keep their promises.
        <br /><br />
        Our money is broken. Prices keep going up. Inflation is out of control. 
        <br /><br />
        What if you could vote for better money instead of another politician with promises?
        <br /><br />
        You can. And you don't need to wait for election day to vote for better money.
        <br /><br />
        Bitcoin is better money. And you can vote for better money by using Bitcoin today.
        </p>

        <p>If you saved $100 in 2020, you only have $50 of purchasing power today.
        <br /><br />
        You may still have that $100 in your bank account, but it buys you half as much as it did a few years ago.
        <br /><br />
        If you saved $100 in Bitcoin in 2020, you have more than $700 of purchasing power today.</p>

        In the United States, there is no fixed limit on how many dollars can be created.
        <br /><br />
        This unlimited supply is the root cause of inflation.
        <br /><br />
        Over the last few years, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL" target="_blank">the total amount of dollars in existence has increased by 400%.</a>
        <br /><br />    
        For every dollar that existed in 2019, there are now four new dollars in existence.
        </p>

        <p>
        This money printing has caused record inflation.
        <br /><br />    
        That’s because when more money is created from nothing, the price of everything in that money goes up.
        <br /><br />
        When trillions of dollars were printed from thin air, the price of everything in dollars went up.
        <br /><br />
        This includes the raw materials that companies have to buy to make their products, which means higher prices for you.
        <br /><br />
        It doesn't really matter who you vote for, because both parties print money and cause inflation.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our national debt has shot past $30 trillion dollars thanks to both Democrats and Republicans.
        <br /><br />
        And there's no sign of this stopping any time soon. 
        <br /><br />    
        More money printing means more inflation.
        <br /><br />
        Inflation is not just rising prices. Inflation is when your money buys you less over time.
        <br /><br />
        Bitcoin is better money because it doesn’t have inflation.
        <br /><br />
        Dollars have an unlimited supply, which means more can be printed at any time.</p>
        
        <center><img src="img/guide-supply.png" class="inline"/></center>
        
        <p>
        <a href="https://voteforbetter.money/learn/bitcoin-is-scarce">Bitcoin is scarce</a> because it has a maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin.
        <br /><br />
        No one can print more Bitcoin, which means no one can cause inflation in the Bitcoin system.
        <br /><br />
        Lots of people use Bitcoin as their long term savings account.
        <br /><br />
        Would you rather save in dollars that buy you less over time?
        <br /><br />
        Or would you rather save in Bitcoin that buys you more over time?
        </p>
        
        <center><img src="img/guide-100-saved-chart.png" class="inline"/></center>
        
        <p>People use Bitcoin as a savings account. But they also use it as a tool for freedom.
        <br /><br />
        This is possible because the Bitcoin network isn’t owned by anyone.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://voteforbetter.money/learn/bitcoin-is-decentralized">Bitcoin is decentralized</a> because it isn't controlled by any single entity like a government or a corporation.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://voteforbetter.money/learn/bitcoin-is-permissionless">Bitcoin is permissionless</a> because anyone, anywhere can join the Bitcoin network. No one can stop you from accessing your money.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://voteforbetter.money/learn/bitcoin-is-american">Bitcoin is American</a> because it upholds freedom and respects proof of work.
        </p>
        
        <center><img src="img/guide-flag.png" class="inline"/></center>
        
        <p><a href="https://bitcoin.rocks/news/energy/bitcoin-mining-stabilizes-texas-power-grid.html" target="_blank">Americans in Texas used Bitcoin to help keep their lights on,</a> even during a massive storm.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://bitcoin.rocks/news/environment/bitcoin-mining-cleaning-up-coal-dumps-usa-pennsylvania.html"  target="_blank">Americans in Pennsylvannia used Bitcoin to clean up coal waste,</a> even after their own government refused to clean it up.
        <br /><br />
        People are using Bitcoin in America and around the world to improve their lives.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gpaXXHEhQQ" target="_blank">Workers in Canada used Bitcoin to access their money,</a> even after their own government froze their bank accounts.
        <br /><br />
        <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1922466/how-bitcoin-powered-nigerias-endsars-protests" target="_blank">Nigerians used Bitcoin to fight for their rights,</a> even after their banks stopped processing donations.
        <br /><br />
        You could use Bitcoin too.
        <br /><br />
        You don't need to wait for election day to vote for better money.
        <br /><br />    
        Bitcoin is better money. And you can vote for better money by using Bitcoin today.
